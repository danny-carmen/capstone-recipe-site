# DANNY CARMEN - FINAL CAPSTONE PROJECT

[RECIPE SITE - TASTABLE] (https://ddc-tastable.herokuapp.com)

My capstone project is a recipe site, with a layout and flow inspired by Pinterest. The front end was developed in React, and styling done in SCSS. The backend was developed using Node.js and Express, with a MongoDB Atlas database. All of the data in the database (recipes, users, and sessions) is stored in JSON format, with the exception of the images, which are uploaded directly from the site to an Amazon S3 account. The frontend reaches the backend through API requests made with Axios.

I utilized Github for version control, and also push my code directly from Github to Heroku, where the site is hosted.

A requirement of the project was to apply a feature or language that was not taught in the course. I chose to develop my backend in Node.js, partially to fulfill this requirement, but also because it seems to be an incredibly popular backend language in the research that I have done. There were also several features that I implemented that were not taught in the course, namely user authentication (via sessions), and search functionality.
